Load Distribution Simulator

Simulates randomized load amounts to processing elements on a distributed system and balances them based upon a load balancing process where indiviual processing elements can only give "load units" to processors directly next to them (wrapping around on the ends, such as in a ring of processors). No actual load is removed, rather this is only to test load balancing algorithms.
